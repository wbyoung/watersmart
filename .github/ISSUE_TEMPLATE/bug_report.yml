        WaterSmart provides the ability to [download diagnostic data](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#debug-logs-and-diagnostics).

        **It would really help if you could download the diagnostics data for
        the vehicle you are having issues with, and <ins>drag-and-drop that file
        into the textbox below.</ins>**

        It generally allows pinpointing defects and thus resolving issues
        faster.
